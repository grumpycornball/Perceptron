# Perceptron

# Why this repository 

When I was in college I did a course on deep learning and realised all I learned was how to use the libraries and was unware of actual back propogation happening in the background. So just for my understanding I started again from scratch. First step was making my own perceptron. Will try to include Neural networks later.

# What this repo contains

1. perceptron_basic.py - Python script to emulate the perceptron learning, It is capable of leaning logic gates (no XOR duh! ) and is able to do linear classification.                    i.e. weights are adjusted with each example set and we keep adjusting the weight untill we get the required ouput.

2. batch.py            - Perceptron with batch learning implemented i.e. weights are adjusted with error taken from batches of example set.

3. stochastic.py       - Perceptron with stochastic leaning i.e. weight are adjusted with each example set but weights are adjusted just once not untill we get the required ourput.
